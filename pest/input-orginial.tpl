Simulation of CO2 injection into the Slack Canyon flow top (Slack Canyon FT2 (SCFT2)). 
Injection into SCFT1 and SCFT2. 
Inputs based on calibrated inputs from case2 of variable rate test. 
Time zero is the start of the pressure monitoring. (1300 hrs 9/21/2012)
Combining White 2020 domain with STOMP shortcourse problem chemsitry (co2-prb-6)
